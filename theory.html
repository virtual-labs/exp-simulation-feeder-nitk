          <p>Feeders are line conductors which connect the stations to the areas to be fed by those stations. So when there is a fault in a feeder, there will be a surge in a current. So for the safety against such faults, circuit breakers are used. These conditions can be viewed in the work station with the help of DCS. Let us see feeders and circuit breakers in detail :</p>
          <p><u><strong>Transmission and distribution of electrical power</strong></u><br>By transmission and distribution of electrical power is meant its conveyance from the central station where it is generated to the places where it is demanded by the consumers (like pumping stations, residential and commercial buildings, mills, factories etc.)</p>
             <ul style="list-style-type: disc">  
          <li>The maximum generated voltage in advanced countries is 33kV while that in India is 11kV.</li>
          <li>The amount of power that has to be transmitted through transmission lines is very large and of this power is transmitted at 11kV (or 33kV) the line current and power loss would be very large. Therefore this voltage is stepped up to a higher value by using step up transformers located in sub-stations.</li>
          <li>The transmission voltages in India are 400 kV, 220 kV and 132 kV.</li>
          <li>The transmission lines and feeders are 3-phase 3-wire circuits.</li>
          <li>The distributors are 3-phase 4-wire circuits because a neutral wire is necessary to supply the single-phase loads of domestic and commercial consumers.</li>
          <li>The transmission network is commonly known as Grid.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><u><strong>Electric supply system:</strong></u></p>
          <p>An electric supply system comprises of the following three principle components:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Power station.</li>
          <li>Transmission lines.</li>
          <li>Distribution lines.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The electrical system is broadly classified as follows:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>D.C. or A.C. system.</li>
          <li>Overhead or underground system.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The overhead system is less expensive than the underground one. In our country this system is mostly adopted for transmission and distribution of power.</p>

          <p>The above figure shows a typical layout of power system between generation and use of electric power<br><u>The various components are discussed below</u>:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Generating station (GS): In generating station electric power is produced by 3-phase alternators operating in parallel.The normal generation voltage is 11kv (it may be 6.6kV or even 33kV in some cases). This voltage is stepped upto 132kV (or more) with the help of 3-phase transformers. Generally the transmission is carried at 66kV, 132kV, 220kV or 400kV.<br><strong>Note</strong> : Whereas the use of high voltage leads to several advantages including saving of conductor material and high transmission efficiency, on the other hand, introduces insulation problems and increases cost of switchgear and transformer equipment.</li>
          <li>Primary transmission: In this type of transmission, the electric power at 132kV is supplied to the other system by 3-phase 3-wire overhead system.</li>
          <li>Secondary transmission: The primary transmission line terminates at the receiving station (RS) where the voltage isreduced to 33kV by step down transformers. From this station, the electric power is transmitted at 33kV to large consumers by 3-phase, 3-wire overhead system, and this forms the secondary transmission.</li>
          <li>Primary distribution: The secondary transmission line terminates at sub-stations(SS) where voltage is reduced from 33kV to 11kV. The 11kV(3-phase,3-wire) lines run along the important road sides of the city.
          <strong>Note</strong>: The large/big consumers(having demand more than 50kw) are normally supplied power at 11kV which they handle it individually with their own substations.</li>
          <li>Secondary distribution: The electric power available at 11kv from the primary distribution line is delivered to distribution substations (DSS, located near the locality of the consumers) which step down the voltage to 400V, 3-phase, 4-wire secondary distribution. The single phase residential lighting load is connected between any phase and neutral (230V) and 3-phase motor load is connected across 3-phase lines (400V) directly.<br>The secondary distribution system consists of feeders, distributors and service mains (see fig (b))</li>
          </ol>

          <ul style="list-style-type: disc">  
          <li><strong>Feeders</strong>: These are line conductors which connect the stations to the areas, to be fed by those stations. Normally no tapping are taken from feeders. They are designed mainly from point of their current carrying capacities.</li>  
          <li><strong>Distributors</strong>: These are conductors from which several tappings for the supply to the consumers are taken. They are designed from the point of view of the voltage drop in them.</li>
          <li><strong>Service mains</strong>: These are the terminals which connect the consumer’s terminals to the distributors.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><u><strong>Comparison between D.C. and A.C. systems of transmission and distribution
          D.C. system</strong></u>:<br>Few advantages: The transmission of electric power by high voltage D.C. systems has following advantages over high voltage A.C. system:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc">  
          <li>DC systems are economical for long distance bulk power transmission by overhead lines.</li>
          <li>Simple line construction.</li>
          <li>Greater power per conductor.</li>
          <li>Ground return is possible.</li>
          <li>In DC system, only IR drop is present and IX drop is nil. Therefore voltage regulation problem is much less serious.</li>
          <li>The power flow through a DC link is easily reversible and controlled.</li>
          <li>In DC transmission, there is no inductance, capacitance, phase displacement and surge problem.</li>
          <li>A DC line has less corona loss.</li>
          <li>A DC line has reduced interference with communication circuits.</li>
          <li>There is no skin effect in DC, X-section of line conductor is therefore fully utilized.</li>
          <li>Because of less potential stress and negligible dielectric loss, underground cable can be used.</li>
          <li>No stability problems.</li>
          <li>No synchronizing difficulties.</li>
          <li>In a DC system, potential stress on the insulation is 1/√2 times that in AC system for same working voltage, therefore less insulation is required in DC system.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><u><strong>Disadvantages</strong></u><br>The high voltage DC systems have the following disadvantages:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc">  
          <li>DC system uses complicated converters and DC switch gear is expensive. Thus installation is costly.</li>
          <li>Electric power cannot be generated at high DC voltage due to commutator problems.</li>
          <li>In DC system harmonics are generated which require filters.</li>
          <li>Converters require considerable reactive power.</li>
          <li>Converters do not have overload capability.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><u><strong>AC system</strong></u>:<br>Nowadays electrical energy is almost exclusively generated, transmitted and distributed in the form of A.C. Let us see its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
          <p><u><strong>Advantages</strong></u>:-</p>
          <ol>
          <li>In A.C. system, the electric power can be generated at high voltage.</li>
          <li>Maintenance of substations is easy and comparatively at a lower cost.</li>
          <li>Stepping-up and stepping down of an A.C voltage can be done easily and efficiently with the help of transformers.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><u><strong>Disadvantages</strong></u>:-</p>
          <ol>
          <li>There is a need to synchronize the alternators before they are put in parallel.</li>
          <li>Transmission line construction is comparatively difficult and the amount of copper required is comparatively more.</li>
          <li>In order to avoid corona loss and also to provide adequate amount of insulation in case of overhead lines, more spacing between the conductors is required.</li>
          <li>As a result of skin effect, the resistance of the line is increased.</li>
          <li>A.C line has capacitance, because of which there is a continues loss of power due to charging current even when the line is open.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><u>Note</u>:-</p>
          <ol>
          <li>The best method is to use A.C system for generation and distribution purpose and DC system for transmission purpose.</li>
          <li>By using mercury are rectifiers and thyratrons, it is possible to transmit electric power by DC system, which can convert AC into DC and vice-versa directly at a reasonable cost. These devices can handle 30 Megawatt at 400V.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Line diagram of typical H.V.D.C transmission lines</p>
          </div>
          
          <p>The above figure shows a single line diagram of high voltage DC (H.V.D.C) transmission. The generating station generates electric power which is AC. This voltage is stepped to high voltage by the use of step-up transformers. This A.C power at high voltage is fed to the mercury are rectifiers which converts AC into DC. This high DC voltage is transmitted. At receiving end the DC power converted to AC power using thyratrons. This AC voltage is then stepped down to low voltage for distribution by using a step-down transformer.</p>
          <p><u><strong>Choice of Transmission Voltage</strong></u><br>Whenever transmission lines are concerned there is a specific limit for the voltage to be used, beyond which there is no economical profit. The limit is reached when the cost of conductor, transformer, insulator, supports, switchgear, lightning arrester and the erection cost is “minimum”.</p>

          </ol>
          <p><u><strong>Underground cables and overhead lines</strong></u><br>Overhead lines and underground cables are the 2 ways for transmission or distribution of electric power. Most of the time overhead lines are used; underground cables are rarely used for the following reason:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Power is generally transmitted over long distances to load centres.</li>
          <li>Installation costs are very high. Therefore, transmission of power over long distances is carried out by using overhead lines.</li>

          <li>Conductors:- Conductors carry power from sending end station to receiving end station.</li>
          <li>Supports:- These are the structures which keep the conductors at a suitable level above the ground; they can be poles or towers, depending upon the working voltage and the place where they are used.</li>
          <li>Cross-arms:- Cross arms provide the necessary support to the insulators.</li>
          <li>Insulators:- They provide insulation to high voltage wire with the metal structure and also provide support to the conductor. They also provide support to bus-bar conductors and other love high voltage equipment terminals.</li>
          <li>Other miscellaneous items:<ol>
          <li>Lightning arresters</li>
          <li>Fuse</li>

          </ol>
          <p><u><strong>Conductors</strong></u><br>The following are the characteristics that conductor used for transmission and distribution should possess:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>In order to withstand mechanical stress, it should have high tensile strength.</li>
          <li>Low resistivity, so that it has high electrical conductivity.</li>
          <li>In order to have small weight per unit volume it should have low specific gravity.</li>
          <li>Low cost.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>All these characteristics are not found in a single material. So, while selecting a conductor material for a particular case, a compromise is made between cost and electrical and mechanical properties.</p>
          <p><u><strong>Material used for transmission lines</strong></u><br>The most important leading material used for transmission lines is copper because it has tensile strength and high conductivity. Aluminium is also used to large extent especially with a steel core for high voltage line. The selection of materials depends upon the following criteria:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Required mechanical strength and electrical properties.</li>
          <li>Cost of materials.</li>
          <li>Local conditions.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>List of other materials used for transmission lines are:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Galvanised steel materials.</li>
          <li>Galvanised iron.</li>
          <li>Steel core copper.</li>
          <li>Cadmium copper materials etc.</li>
          <li>Phosphor bronze materials etc.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Let us see few of them in brief.</p>
          <ol>
          <li><u>Copper</u>:-<ol>
          <li>Copper that has not been annealed after being drawn (Hard drawn copper) conductor is one of the best conductors due to its high electrical conductivity and high tensile strength for all types of transmission. Hard drawing reduces electrical conductivity by a small amount but it increases the tensile strength considerably.</li>
          <li>It is a homogeneous material, durability is high and has high scrap value.</li>
          <li>It has a high current density so lesser X-sectional area of conductor is required.</li>
          </ol>
          </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Copper conductor having steel core are employed for long span transmission lines, where a combination of high conductivity, small sag and minimum cross-section are desired.</p>
          <ol start="2">
          <li><p><u>Aluminium</u>:-</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Lighter in weight as compared to copper, but has smaller conductivity and tensile strength.</li>
          <li>Aluminium has 1.6 items the resistivity of copper. So for the same loss and length of conductor an aluminium conductor should have 60% greater x-sectional area than that of copper conductor. This increased X-section of aluminium exposes a greater surface to wind pressure. So the supporting towers must be designed for greater transvers strength. As consequences of greater sag, the use of higher towers is often required.</li>
          <li>The sag in aluminium conductors is greater than the copper conductors.</li>
          <li>They are particularly suitable for operation in very high ambient temperature.</li>
          </ol>
          </li>
          <li><p><u>Steel cored aluminium (A.C.S.R)</u><br>Aluminium has low tensile strength, as a result produce greater sag which prohibits their use for longer spans and makes them unsuitable for long distance transmissions. So in order to increase the tensile strength of the aluminium conductor, it is used with a core of galvanized steel wires. The combinational conductor thus obtained is called as A.C.S.R. (Aluminium Conductor Steel Reinforced).</p>

          </li>
          <li><p><u>Cadmium copper</u><br> Sometimes copper alloyed with cadmium is used. When 1 or 2 percentage of cadmium is added to copper it increases the tensile strength by about 40 percentages but reduces the conductivity only by 17 percentages. Cadmium copper is expensive than copper.</p>

          </ol>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
          <li> In a pin type insulator its cost is increased rapidly as the working voltage is increased. Therefore pin type insulator is not economical beyond 33kV. So it is as usual practice to use suspension type insulators for voltage higher than 33kV.</li>
          <li> A pin type insulator sits on top of the cross arm, whereas a suspension insulator hangs from the cross arm. The line conductor is attached to its lower end.</li>

          </ol>
          <p><u>Sag in overhead lines</u>:<br>In transmission lines, the conductors are supported at the towers or poles. When the conductor supported in this manner it will sag or dip under its own weight and it takes the shape of catenary.
          The distance between the adjacent supporting towers is called the “span”. The difference in level between the points of supports and the lowest points is known as sag.</p>
          <p>The factors affecting the sag in overhead lines are:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Weight of the conductor:The weight of the conductor directly affects the sag. Heavier the conductor, greater will be the sag.</li>
          <li>Span length: Sag is directly proportional to the square of the span length, provided other conditions remain unchanged.</li>
          <li>If other conditions are remaining the same, then the sag is inversely proportional to the working tensile strength.</li>
          <li>Sag increases with the increase in temperature.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><u><strong>Note</strong></u>:-<br>Few important terms:</p>
          <ol>
          <li><p><u>Skin effect</u>:<br>When direct currents are concerned, the direct current distributes themselves uniformly over the cross-section of the conductor and therefore use the centre of the conductor as effectively as they use the periphery. When alternating current is concerned, ac owing to inductance effects within the conductor, crowd toward the outside of the conductor. This behaviour is termed as ‘skin effect’. Skin effect raises the apparent resistance of the conducting material, only the total resistance of conductor is changed depending upon the frequency of the current and also the diameter of the conductor. The total resistance of the conductor increases, as the frequency of the current increases, and also increases with the increase in the diameter of the conductor. The current carried by the centre portion of the conductors is reduced by skin effect, thus hollow conductors are sometimes employed to use them more effectively. More often instead of hollow conductor, Aluminium cable steel reinforced (ACSR) is used.
          The skin effect is negligible when the supply frequency is low (&lt;50Hz) and the conductor diameter is small (&lt;1cm)</p>
          </li>
          <li><p><u>Proximity Effect</u>:<br>The alternating magnetic flux in a conductor caused by the current following in a neighbouring conductor gives rise to circulating currents which cause an apparent increase in the resistance of a conductor. This phenomenon is called “proximity effect”.<br>Proximity effect is always of negligible order for normal spinning of overhead lines. However, for underground cables where conductors are spaced closely to each other, the effective resistance of the conductor is greatly increased due to proximity effect.</p>
          </li>
          </ol>
          <p>The factors which effect skin and proximity effects are:-</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Frequency of the current.</li>
          <li>Permeability of the conductor material.</li>

          <p><u><strong>Circuit breakers</strong></u>
          A circuit breaker is an automatically operated electrical switch designed for to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by overload or short circuit. Or, in other words, the function of a circuit breaker is to isolate the faulty part of the power system in case of abnormal conditions. A protective relay detects abnormal conditions and sends a tripping signal to the circuit breaker. After receiving the trip command signal from the relay the circuit breaker isolates the faulty part of the power system.</p>

          <p>fig(m)<br>Separation of the contacts of the circuit breaker</p>
          </div>
          
          <p>A circuit breaker has two contacts- a fixed contact and a moving contact. Under normal conditions these two contacts remain in closed position. When the circuit breaker is required to isolate the faulty part, the moving contact moves to interrupt the circuit. On the separation of the contacts, the flow of current is interrupted, resulting in the formation of an arc between the contacts. These contacts are placed in a closed chamber containing some insulating medium (like gas or liquid) which extinguish the arc.</p>
          <p>Insulating fluid is used for arc extension and the fluid chosen depends upon the rating and type of circuit breaker. The insulating fluids commonly used for circuit breaker are:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Air at atmospheric pressure</li>
          <li>Compressed air</li>
          <li>Ultra high vacuum</li>
          <li>Oil which produces hydrogen for arc extension</li>
          <li>Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6 )</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Some of the gases which have been used in circuit breaker are:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Electromagnetic gases : Sulphur hexafluoride , arcton</li>
          <li>Simple gases: Air, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The important characteristics of the fluids used in circuit breaker are:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>It should have good thermal and chemical stability.</li>
          <li>It should have high declarative strength.</li>
          <li>Non-inflammability and high thermal conductivity.</li>
          <li>Arc extinguish ability.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><u><strong>Classification of circuit breakers</strong></u></p>

          </ol>
          <p>Let us see some of the features of major circuit breakers:</p>
          <p>(1) <u>OIL CIRCUIT BREAKERS (O.C.B)</u>:<br>Oil circuit breakers are the most common and oldest type of circuit breakers. The rating range of circuit breakers lies in range of 25MVA at 2.5kV and 5000MVA at 250kV. In oil circuit breaker, the separating contacts are made to separate within insulating oil medium, which has better insulating properties than air.</p>
          <p><u>Few advantages of using oil as an Arc quenching medium</u>:-</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Dielectric strength is high</li>
          <li>As a result of decomposition of oil, it has good cooling property</li>
          <li>It acts as an insulator between live part and earth</li>
          <li>Surrounding oil in close proximity to the arc presents a large cooling surface</li>
          </ol>
          <p><u>Few disadvantages</u>:-</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Highly inflammable and can cause an explosion by mixing with air</li>
          <li>It requires maintenance</li>
          <li>Periodic replacement</li>
          </ol>
          <p>(2) <u>AIR BLAST CIRCUIT BREAKERS</u>:-<br>Air blast circuit breakers is a type of circuit breaker which use a high pressure air blast (at a pressure of 20bar) as an arc quenching medium. Range  132kV and above up to 400kV ,with the braking capacity up to 7500MVA .But can also be designed to cover the wide range of 66kV to 132kV.</p>
          <p><u>Few advantages</u>:-</p>
          <ol>
          <li>No risk of explosion and fire hazards</li>
          <li>Consistent and short arc duration</li>
          <li>Since the arc duration is short and consistent, the burning of the contact is less due to less arc energy</li>
          <li>High speed enclosures facility</li>
          <li>Comparatively less maintenance required</li>
          </ol>
          <p><u>Few disadvantages</u>:-</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Current chopping</li>
          <li>Sensitivity to restricting voltage</li>
          </ol>
          <p>(3) <u>SULPHUR HEXAFLUORIDE(SF<sub>6</sub>)CIRCUIT BREAKER</u>:-<br>Sulphur hexafluoride to other medium such as oil or air for the use in circuit breakers for the following reasons:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Being an Inert gas, it is non-reactive to the other components of circuit breakers</li>
          <li>Sulphur hexafluoride has high dielectric strength (about 24 times that of air and it is comparable to that of oil)</li>
          <li>When extinction of arc is concerned it is about 100 times more effective than air</li>
          <li>Its heat transfer property is about 16times that of air because of its high density</li>
          </ol>
          <p><u>Applications</u>:-</p>
          <ol>
          <li>The circuit breakers are designed for voltages 115kV to 230kV, power rating of 10MVA to 20MVA and interrupting times less than 3cycles.</li>
          <li>A typical sulphur hexafluoride circuit breaker consist of interrupter units, each capable of dealing with currents up to 60000A and voltage in the range of 50 to 80kV.A number of units are connected in series according to the voltage of the system.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><u>Few Advantages</u>:-</p>
          <ol>
          <li>No risk of fire</li>
          <li>No reduction of dielectric strength</li>
          <li>Arcing time is very short; this reduces the erosion of contact</li>
          <li>Its operation is very silent</li>
          <li>The current chopping tendency is minimized by using sulphur hexafluoride gas at low pressure and low velocity</li>
          <li>The breaker is compact in size and totally enclosed. Thus electrical clearances are drastically reduced and are particularly suitable where explosion hazard exists, like coal mines</li>
          </ol>
          <p><u>Disadvantages</u>:-</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Expensive</li>
          <li>Sulphur hexafluoride gas has to be reconditioned after every operation of the breaker and additional equipment is required for this purpose</li>
          </ol>
          <p>(4) <u>VACUUM CIRCUIT BREAKERS(V.C.B)</u>:-<br>Vacuum means the pressure below atmospheric pressure which is 760 mm of Hg. In a vacuum circuit breaker, vacuum of the order of 10<sup>-5</sup> to 10<sup>-7</sup> (1 torr = 1 mm of Hg) is used as the arc quenching medium. The dielectric strength of the vacuum is 1000 times more than that of any other medium.</p>
          <p><u>Applications</u>:-</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Vacuum breakers are being used for outdoor applications ranging from 22kV to 66kV. They are also suitable for majority of applications in several areas even with limited rating say 60 to 100MVA.</li>
          <li>Vacuum circuit breakers are used for capacitor-bank switching, transformer, reacting switching, where the voltages are high and current to be interrupted is low.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><u>Few important terms regarding circuit breakers</u>:-</p>
          <ol>
          <li><p><u>Arc voltage </u>:-<br>The voltage across the contacts during the arcing period is known as the "arc voltage ".</p>
          </li>
          <li><p><u>Restriking voltage</u>:-<br>The transient voltage appearing across the contacts during arc period is called the "restriking voltage".</p>
          </li>
          <li><p><u>Recovery voltage</u>:-<br>It is normal frequency (50Hz) r.m.s. voltage that appears across the contact of the circuit breaker after the final extinction. It is approximately equal to the system voltage.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p><u>Rate of Rise of restriking voltage(RRRV)</u>:-<br>The average RRRV = Peak value of restriking voltage/Time taken to reach the peak value</p>
          </li>
          <li><p><u>Current Chopping</u>:-<br>When low inductive current (e.g. current to a shunt reactor or magnetising current of a transformer) is interrupted by a circuit breaker and the arc quenching force of the circuit breaker is more than necessary to interrupt a low magnitude of current, the current will be interrupted before its manual zero instant. It is termed as current chopping.</p>
          </li>
          </ol>
          <p><u><strong>Rating of circuit breakers</strong></u>:-<br>A circuit breaker is expected to perform the following duties (besides normal working) under short circuit/fault conditions:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>To open the contacts to clear the fault and isolating the faulty section.</li>
          <li>To close the contacts on to a fault.</li>
          <li>It must be able to carry fault current for a short time while another circuit breaker (in series) is clearing the fault.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Therefore, in addition to the rated voltage, current and frequency, circuit breakers have the following important ratings.</p>
          <ol style="list-style-type: number">
          
          <li>Breaking capacity</li>
          <li>Making capacity</li>
          <li>Short-time capacity</li>
          </ol>
          
          <ol>
          <li><u>Breaking capacity</u>:-<br>It is the current (r.m.s. value) that a circuit breaker is capable of breaking under specified conditions (e.g. PPPV, power factor) and given recovery voltage.</li>
          </ol>
          <div style="text-align: center">
          
          <p><a href="./images/feeder15.png"><img src="./images/feeder15.png" width="550" height="25"></a></p>
          </div>
          
          <p>Where V=Rated service lines in volts,<br> I =rated breaking current (symmetrical or asymmetrical) in ampere.</p>
          <ol start="2">
          <li><p><u>Making capacity</u>:-<br>The peak value of current (including the DC component) during first cycle of current wave after the closure of circuit breaker is known as "making capacity".<br>Making capacity = 2.55 × symmetrical breaking capacity</p>
          </li>
          <li><p><u>Short-time capacity</u>:-<br>The short time rating of a circuit breaker depends upon its ability to withstand the temperature rise and the electromagnetic force effects. The oil circuit breakers have a specified limit of 3 seconds when the ratio of symmetrical breaking current to the rated normal current does not exceed 40. However if this ratio exceeds 40, then the specified limit is 1second.</p>
          </li>
          </ol>
          <p><u>Normal current rating</u>:- It is the r.m.s value of current which the circuit breaker is capable of carrying continuously at its rated frequency under specified conditions.</p>
